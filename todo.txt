Design level select screen (pick between levels, shows best total score)
Add portal system (teleport between parts of maze, based on colors) (portal contains color + tag for telling between them)

Ok so for the level select screen, I'd need to show/hide the canvas/game based on which state things are in, then add some sort of list that shows all levels, maybe as a sort of table?
