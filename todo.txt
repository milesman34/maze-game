Add portal system (teleport between parts of maze, based on colors) (portal contains color + tag for telling between them)

Design some more levels to play

It seems for portals I will have to define them on both sides as there isn't really a logical way to implement it otherwise

to fix this, iterate over all room links and set up some sort of map from room name to its links when defining the level
