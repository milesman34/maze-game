Design level select screen (pick between levels, shows best total score)
Add portal system (teleport between parts of maze, based on colors) (portal contains color + tag for telling between them)

While the level select screen works now, I still need to figure out a way to display the coins/steps stats after completing a level, either with a level end screen or something else?
