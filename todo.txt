Design the current Locked level + 1 or 2 more levels for testing
Design level select screen (pick between levels, shows best total score)
Add portal system (teleport between parts of maze, based on colors) (portal contains color + tag for telling between them)
Make tooling/level design less painful to use?

Honestly to make level design work I'd need to implement a level editor, and that seems really difficult.
