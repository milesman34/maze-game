Add key/lock system (may require ways to color an object dynamically), probably will be exclusive to each screen
Add energy system eventually?

Key/lock system could have each level keep track of the position of keys and their colors (which will be important, maybe link to constants, generate key textures)
For keys, use some sort of record that links key colors (name of color?) to a list of key positions, so one color can have multiple keys
For locks, use some sort of record that links key colors to a list of lock positions, when the required key is collected the locks are all removed
Track how many keys of a certain color are collected

Yeah, mapping keys/locks based off their color seems like the best call here

If I figure out how to render it, I could also have special locks which require multiple of a specific colored key to unlock, and they display how many more keys of that color are required

Actually, instead of telling all locks when a key has been collected, we can only update the locks on screen, then when we load another room, update the locks based on level key data.

Locks are tricky because I have to render a lock over a wall. To do that, maybe I will need to have some ability to change the definition of a sprite for a Tile object to be a container,
or maybe override the draw/deleteSprite methods to handle this. Maybe I should implement a better way for drawing objects.
