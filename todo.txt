Add key/lock system (may require ways to color an object dynamically), probably will be exclusive to each screen
Add energy system eventually?

Key/lock system seems to work now, but I'll still need to figure out a way to display if it needs >1 key (work with Pixi.js text maybe?)
Maybe I could find some way to display what keys the player has, but that would be difficult
