Consider switching to TypeScript
Add score tracker (collecting coins adds points)
Add multiple types of coins/walls (different textures/values, etc)
Add some way to store multiple levels and link them together
Add ways to go from 1 level to another (will be a bit more complicated)
Add energy system eventually?
